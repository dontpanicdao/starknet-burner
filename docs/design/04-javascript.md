## starknet.js and svelte to the rescue

starknet.js is used inside the mobile application to provide some important
facilities like computing hash and signing. You might want to check the code of
the library to understand how iy works and use it...

At some point the burner wallet might implement some API to make it accessible
also via starknet.js and, why not get-starknet so that people can choose to use
it or to use another wallet supported on the Dapp. That is a long way to go and
it is actually not planned for now. To start, we will provide simple flows to
use the wallet in specific use cases, like video games or token mint/exchange.
