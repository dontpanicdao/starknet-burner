## starknet.js and svelte to the rescue

At some point the wallet might implement some API to make it accessible and why not get-starknet so that people can choose to use it or to use another wallet supported on the Dapp. Anyway, that is a long way to go and for now, we are
providing simple flows to use the wallet in specific use cases, like video games or token mint/exchange.
