## Welcome Contributors

There are many ways to contribute to the project. The best one by far is to
to imagine what kind of application or service you could write if you did not
have to validate every transaction. If you have an idea, it could be something
completely new in the blockchain world, start it and use the burner. If it does
not meet your requirement, get in touch with us in the `# ðŸ’³ï½œstarknet-burner`
channel of Starknet Discord.

That is obviously not everything, you can:

- Star the project and tweet about it
- Read the doc, improve the doc, blog, create videos
- Provide sample applications and sample integration with libraries
- Request new features and usage scenarios
- Read the code and provide feedback, questions and corrections
- Take an issue and help with addressing it

Now if you want to dig into the code, check the 
[introduction](./dev/introduction.md) section of the developer guide.
