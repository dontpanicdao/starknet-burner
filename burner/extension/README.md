## Why use the Starknet Burner?

See the Starknet Burner as a way to create and some temporary/limited keys
that could be validated by your personal wallet like Argent-X for some
specific purposes. What could you do with it?

- You could use that key for a limited time to interact in an "auto-validating"
  scenario with a video game or some social engaging activities. This could
  only position at risk a small part of your assets.
- You could provide the key to a third party, including friends, relatives
  or managed services to use it with a for a very specific case.
- You could use it as part of a multi-party interaction with an service that
  could/would only approve a subset of conditions. For instance you could wire
  a monthly amount to a specific account
- You would use it to access an account managed by a third party for some
  specific operations. 

Ultimately, Starknet Burner is a project that would help people to experience
the power of Starknet with the ease of regular web and mobile applications.
