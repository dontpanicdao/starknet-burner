/**
 * It's possible to tell SvelteKit how to type objects inside your app by declaring the `App` namespace. By default, a new project will have a file called `src/app.d.ts` containing the following:
 *
 * ```ts
 * /// <reference types="@sveltejs/kit" />
 *
 * declare namespace App {
 * 	interface Locals {}
 *
 * 	interface PageData {}
 *
 * 	interface Platform {}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By populating these interfaces, you will gain type safety when using `event.locals`, `event.platform`, and `data` from `load` functions.
 *
 * Note that since it's an ambient declaration file, you have to be careful when using `import` statements. Once you add an `import`
 * at the top level, the declaration file is no longer considered ambient and you lose access to these typings in other files.
 * To avoid this, either use the `import(...)` function:
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface Locals {
 * 	user: import('$lib/types').User;
 * }
 * ```
 * Or wrap the namespace with `declare global`:
 * ```ts
 * import { User } from '$lib/types';
 *
 * declare global {
 * 	namespace App {
 * 		interface Locals {
 * 			user: User;
 * 		}
 * 		// ...
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 */
