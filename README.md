A Javascript wallet to interact with Starknet from mobile and web applications.

## What is Starknet Burner?

The Starknet Burner is a wallet built to help users that needs to interact
with the Starknet network for a limited time and for a limited number of
assets from mobile and web applications. Ideal to work with blockchain
games or social activities, the project includes:

- the `burner` is a javascript library that can easily be added to any web
  or mobile applications and provides a simple way to interact with Starknet;
- `drone` is a web3 application that works on a browser with the argent-x
  wallet. `drone` helps users to grant access to their account from the burner.
  It also provides a simple way to track and monitor what the burner is doing;
  enabling users to block the `burner` whenever they want.
- the argent-x account `plugin` is an extension to the argent-x account; it is
  used by the `burner` to invoke commands;
